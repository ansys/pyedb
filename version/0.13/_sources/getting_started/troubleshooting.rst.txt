Troubleshooting
===============

This section first explains how to create PyEDB issues and post EDB discussions. It then
describes  how to troubleshoot some common issues related to installing and using PyEDB.

Issues and discussions
----------------------

On the `PyEDB Issues <https://github.com/ansys/pyedb/issues>`_ page, you can
create issues to report bugs and request new features.

On the `PyEDB Discussions <https://github.com/ansys/pyedb/discussions>`_ page or
the `Discussions <https://discuss.ansys.com/>`_ page on the Ansys Developer portal, you
can post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback.

To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com <pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_.

Installation troubleshooting
----------------------------

Error installing Python or Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some companies do not allow installation of a Python interpreter. In this case, you can
use the Python interpreter available in the AEDT installation.

.. note::

   Python 3.10 is available in AEDT 2023 R2 and later.

Here is the path to the Python 3.10 interpreter for the 2023 R1 installation:

.. code:: python

   "path\to\AnsysEM\v231\commonfiles\CPython\3_10\winx64\Release\python"


Error installing PyEDB using ``pip``
-----------------------------------
According to `Installing Python modules <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>`_
in the official Python documentation, `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_, the preferred
installer program, is included by default with Python binary installers. If you have issues
using ``pip``, check these areas for possible issues:

- **Proxy server**: If your company uses a proxy server, you may have to update proxy
  settings at the command line. For more information, see the `Using a Proxy
  Server <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server>`_ in the ``pip``
  documentation.
- **Installation permission**: Make sure that you have write access to the directory where the
  Python interpreter is installed. The use of a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_
  helps mitigate this issue by placing the Python interpreter and dependencies in a location that is owned
  by the user.
- **Firewall**: Some corporate firewalls may block ``pip``. In this case, you must work with your IT
  administrator to enable it. The proxy server settings (described earlier) allow you to explicitly define
  the ports that ``pip`` is to use.

If downloads from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_, the Python Package Index, are not allowed, you can use a
`wheelhouse <https://pypi.org/project/Wheelhouse/>`_ to install PyEDB. For more information, see :ref:`install_pyedb_from_wheelhouse.`

Run PyEDB with gRPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`gRPC <https://grpc.io/>`_ is a modern open source, high-performance RPC (remote procedure call)
framework that can run in any environment and supports client/server remote calls.
Starting from 2024 R1, the EDB-Core API with a gRPC interface is available as Beta.
During the Beta phase, both .NET and gRPC interfaces are set to be maintained.
Once gRPC is officially released, it is planned for gRPC to become the default usage in PyEDB, with .NET being set up as an legacy.
