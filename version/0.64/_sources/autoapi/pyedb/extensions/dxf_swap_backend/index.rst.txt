.. py:function:: create_polygon_from_dxf(edb: pyedb.Edb, dxf_path: str, layer_name: str) -> pyedb.grpc.database.primitive.primitive.Primitive

   
   Create a polygon primitive in the EDB layout from the first entity
   found in a DXF file.


   :Parameters:

       **edb** : :obj:`Edb`
           An active EDB (Electronics Database) instance that the polygon
           will be added to.

       **dxf_path** : :class:`python:str`
           Absolute or relative path to the DXF file containing the
           geometry to import.

       **layer_name** : :class:`python:str`
           Name of the EDB layer on which the polygon will be created.

   :Returns:

       :obj:`Primitive`
           The newly created polygon primitive object.








   .. rubric:: Notes

   * Only the first entity in the DXF modelspace is used; all other
     entities are ignored.
   * Coordinates in the DXF are assumed to be in **microns** and are
     divided by 1000 to convert to **millimetres** before being passed
     to EDB.
   * The resulting polygon is **not** translated or rotated; it is
     placed exactly as defined in the DXF (after scaling).


   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> edb = Edb(edbpath="my_design.aedb")
   >>> poly = create_polygon_from_dxf(edb, dxf_path="outline.dxf", layer_name="Outline")
   >>> print(poly)
   <pyedb.dotnet.edb_core.edb_data.primitives.EDBPrimitives object ...>

.. py:function:: swap_polygon_with_dxf(edb: pyedb.Edb, dxf_path: str, layer_name: str, point_dxf: List[str], point_aedt: List[str])

   
   Replace an existing polygon on a given layer with a new polygon
   imported from a DXF file, aligning the two geometries via reference
   points.


   :Parameters:

       **edb** : :obj:`Edb`
           An active EDB instance.

       **dxf_path** : :class:`python:str`
           Path to the DXF file that contains the replacement geometry.

       **layer_name** : :class:`python:str`
           Layer on which the old polygon will be deleted and the new one
           created.

       **point_dxf** : :obj:`List`\[:class:`python:str`]
           Two-element list of strings specifying the **reference point**
           inside the DXF geometry (units: **mm**).
           Example: ``["-1.5", "4.2"]``.

       **point_aedt** : :obj:`List`\[:class:`python:str`]
           Two-element list of strings specifying the **target location**
           in the EDB layout where the DXF reference point should land
           (units: **mm**).
           Example: ["12.0", "7.5"].

   :Returns:

       :data:`python:None`
           The function operates in-place on the provided EDB instance.








   .. rubric:: Notes

   * Only the first entity in the DXF modelspace is used.
   * Both input points are internally converted to **metres** before
     computing the translation vector.
   * The translation vector is then scaled back to **millimetres**
     and expressed as strings with an "mm" suffix, as required by
     the EDB move API.


   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> edb = Edb(edbpath="design.aedb")
   >>> swap_polygon_with_dxf(
   ...     edb,
   ...     dxf_path="new_outline.dxf",
   ...     layer_name="Outline",
   ...     point_dxf=["0", "0"],  # Origin in DXF
   ...     point_aedt=["10", "5"],  # Where DXF origin should land
   ... )
   >>> edb.save()

.. py:function:: swap_polygon_with_dxf_center_point(edb: pyedb.Edb, dxf_path: str, layer_name: str, point_aedt: List[str])

   
   Replace an existing polygon on a given layer with a new polygon
   imported from a DXF file, aligning the two geometries via reference
   points. Uses the center point of the DXF polygon as reference (not an input point).


   :Parameters:

       **edb** : :obj:`Edb`
           An active EDB instance.

       **dxf_path** : :class:`python:str`
           Path to the DXF file that contains the replacement geometry.

       **layer_name** : :class:`python:str`
           Layer on which the old polygon will be deleted and the new one
           created.

       **point_aedt** : :obj:`List`\[:class:`python:str`]
           Two-element list of strings specifying the **target location**
           in the EDB layout where the DXF reference point should land
           (units: **mm**).
           Example: ["12.0", "7.5"].

   :Returns:

       :data:`python:None`
