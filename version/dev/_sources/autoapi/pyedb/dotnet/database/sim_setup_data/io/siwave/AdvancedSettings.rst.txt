   ..

.. py:property:: return_current_distribution

   
   Whether to enable the return current distribution.
   This option is used to accurately model the change of the characteristic impedance
   of transmission lines caused by a discontinuous ground plane. Instead of injecting
   the return current of a trace into a single point on the ground plane,
   the return current for a high impedance trace is spread out.
   The trace return current is not distributed when all traces attached to a node
   have a characteristic impedance less than 75 ohms or if the difference between
   two connected traces is less than 25 ohms.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if return current distribution is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: ignore_non_functional_pads

   
   Exclude non-functional pads.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           `True`` if functional pads have to be ignored, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: include_coplane_coupling

   
   Whether to enable coupling between traces and adjacent plane edges.
   This option provides a model for crosstalk between signal lines and planes.
   Plane edges couple to traces when they are parallel.
   Traces and coplanar edges that are oblique to each other do not overlap
   and cannot be considered for coupling.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if coplane coupling is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..

.. py:property:: include_fringe_coupling

   
   Whether to include the effect of fringe field coupling between stacked cavities.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if fringe coupling is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: include_split_plane_coupling

   
   Whether to account for coupling between adjacent parallel plane edges.
   Primarily, two different cases are being considered:
   - Plane edges that form a split.
   - Plane edges that form a narrow trace-like plane.
   The former leads to crosstalk between adjacent planes for which
   a specific coupling model is applied. For the latter, fringing effects
   are considered to model accurately the propagation characteristics
   of trace-like cavities. Further, the coupling between narrow planes is
   also modeled by enabling this feature.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if split plane coupling is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: include_infinite_ground

   
   Whether to Include a ground plane to serve as a voltage reference for traces and planes
   if they are not defined in the layout.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if infinite ground is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..

.. py:property:: include_trace_coupling

   
   Whether to model coupling between adjacent traces.
   Coupling is considered for parallel and almost parallel trace segments.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if trace coupling is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: include_vi_sources

   
   Whether to include the effect of parasitic elements from voltage and
   current sources.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if vi sources is used, ``False`` otherwise.

   Whether to automatically pick a suitable mesh refinement frequency,
   depending on drawing size, number of modes, and/or maximum sweep
   frequency.

   .. deprecated:: 0.54.0
      Use :func:`automatic_mesh` instead.




   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if automatic mesh is used, ``False`` otherwise.











   ..

   Whether to automatically pick a suitable mesh refinement frequency,
   depending on drawing size, number of modes, and/or maximum sweep
   frequency.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if automatic mesh is used, ``False`` otherwise.

.. py:property:: perform_erc

   
   Whether to perform an electrical rule check while generating the solver input.
   In some designs, the same net may be divided into multiple nets with separate names.
   These nets are connected at a "star" point. To simulate these nets, the error checking
   for DC shorts must be turned off. All overlapping nets are then internally united
   during simulation.





   :Returns:

       :ref:`bool <python:bltin-boolean-values>`
           ``True`` if perform erc is used, ``False`` otherwise.
