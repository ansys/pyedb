Property detail
---------------

.. py:property:: auto_removal_sliver_poly

.. py:property:: cell_per_wave_length

   
   This setting describes the number of cells that fit under each wavelength. The wavelength is
   calculated according to the Max Frequency or the Mesh Frequency, unless specified by user through
   this setting. E.g. Setting Cells/Wavelength to 20 means that an object will be divided into 10 cells
   if its width or length is 1/2 wavelengths.
   Units: unitless.
















   ..

.. py:property:: edge_mesh

   
   This option controls both, the thickness and the width of the exterior conductor filament.
   When specified, it prevails over the Mesh Frequency or Max Frequency during mesh calculation.
   Example: "0.8um".
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: eliminate_slit_per_hole

   
   This is a setting that internally simplifies layouts with strain relief or thermal relief slits and
   holes. It will examine each hole separately against the whole polygon it belongs to.
   If the area of the hole is below the threshold defined in this setting, then the hole will be filled.
   Units: unitless.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: mesh_frequency

   
   User can override the default meshing applied by setting a custom frequency for mesh generation.
   Example: "1GHz".

.. py:property:: net_settings_options

   
   A list of Name, Value pairs that stores advanced option.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: override_shrink_fac

   
   Set the shrink factor explicitly, that is, review what-if scenarios of migrating to half-node
   technologies.
   Units: unitless.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: plane_projection_factor

   
   To eliminate unnecessary mesh complexity of "large" metal planes and improve overall extraction time,
   user can define the mesh of certain planes using a combination of the Plane Projection Factor and
   settings of the Nets Advanced Options.
   Units: unitless.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: use_accelerate_via_extraction

   
   Setting this option will simplify/merge neighboring vias before sending the layout for processing
   to the mesh engine and to the EM engine.

.. py:property:: use_enable_etch_transform

   
   Pre-distorts the layout based on the foundry rules, applying the conductor's bias (positive/negative –
   deflation/inflation) at the conductor edges due to unavoidable optical effects in the manufacturing process.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: use_enable_hybrid_extraction

   
   This setting allows the modelling engine to separate the layout into two parts in an attempt to
   decrease the complexity of EM modelling.

   This setting models substrate coupling effects using an equivalent distributed RC network.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: use_extract_floating_metals_dummy

   
   Enables modeling of floating metals as dummy fills. Captures the effect of dummy fill by extracting
   the effective capacitance between any pairs of metal segments in the design, in the presence of each
   individual dummy metal islands. This setting cannot be used with UseExtractFloatingMetalsFloating.

.. py:property:: use_lde

   
   Takes into account the variation of resistivity as a function of a conductor’s drawn width and spacing to
   its neighbors or as a function of its local density, due to dishing, slotting, cladding thickness, and so
   on.
