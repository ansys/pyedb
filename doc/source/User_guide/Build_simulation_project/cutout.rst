Clipping layout
===============
Because most of the time only a specific part of a layout must be simulated, clipping the design
needs to be performed to reduce computer resources and speed up simulation. This section describes
how to clip a design based on nets selection.

    # defining the expansion factor. The value gives the distance for evaluating the cutout extent. Here we define a cutout
    expansion = 0.01  # 1cm in this case
    # processing cutout

        signal_list=signal_nets, reference_list=reference_nets, expansion_size=expansion
    )
