High-Frequency Layout Examples (PyAEDT + PyEDB)
-----------------------------------------------

These examples show how PyEDB and PyAEDT work together to create solve and post-process high-frequency PCB/IC packages and RF boards.
They are maintained in the main PyAEDT example gallery and include:

* Import and modification of EDB layout
* HFSS 3-D and HFSS 3-D Layout set-ups
* Frequency sweeps, field plots, S-parameter export
* Parametric studies and optimization loops

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you would like to add new PyEDB-focused examples to this collection.

This examples are focused on using PyEDB to create, modify, and analyze PCB/IC packages and RF boards. The basic
section covers fundamental tasks, while the advanced section demonstrates more complex workflows for Si-PI.

PyEDB workflows
===============

PyEDB provides a powerful interface for automating PCB design tasks.
The following sections contain examples that illustrate various workflows using PyEDB.
