# Perform required imports, which includes importing a section.

# ## Download ANSYS EDB
# Download ANSYS generic design from public repository.

# Using the net name setter to rename.

# Selecting all nets from ddr4_dqs and component U1 and create coaxial ports
# On corresponding pins.

# Renaming all port with _renamed string as suffix example.

# ## Saving and closing EDB
# Once the EDB saved and closed, this can be imported in ANSYS AEDT as an HFSS 3D Layout project.
